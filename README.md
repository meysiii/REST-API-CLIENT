# Description

https://github.com/meysiii/REST-API-CLIENT

# 👋 Introduction

The project focuses on understanding how Java applications interact with external systems using RESTful APIs, handle HTTP requests, and process JSON responses in real-world scenarios.

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with API integration, client–server communication, and JSON parsing using Java.

# 📄 Project Description

The Java REST API Client is a console-based application that consumes a public REST API to fetch real-time weather information for a given city.

The application sends an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API, receives the response in JSON format, parses the data, and displays it in a clean, structured, and user-friendly manner.

Unlike static or offline programs, this project demonstrates how Java applications can dynamically retrieve live data from external services. It showcases the fundamental working of REST APIs without using complex frameworks, making it simple, beginner-friendly, and easy to understand.

# ✨ Features

Consumes a public REST API using Java

Handles HTTP requests and responses

Parses JSON data using Gson library

Displays weather data in a structured format

Real-time data fetching from external API

Beginner-friendly and well-structured Java code

Console-based output for simplicity

# 🔧 Tech Stack

Java 11 – Core programming language

Java HttpClient – Handling HTTP requests

Gson Library – JSON parsing

REST API – OpenWeatherMap public API

# 🚀 How It Works

The user specifies a city name in the program

Java HttpClient sends an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API

The API returns weather data in JSON format

Gson parses the JSON response

Required details such as temperature, humidity, and weather condition are extracted

The data is displayed in a structured console output
